# Algorithms

My objectives with this repository are:
 - Practice my python skills writing some algorithms.
 - Gain more in depth knowledge about unittest.
 - Use pre-commits.
 - Learn how to add those fancy github badges on the README file.
 - I'd love to use gitflow but it doesn't make much sense with such a small non-collaborative project.

Probably more objectives will be added as time passes.
